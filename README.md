**Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python**

A simple Python script that demonstrates encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher technique. This implementation allows users to:

- Encrypt text by shifting characters by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.
- Decrypt text to recover the original message.
- Handle both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

 **Features**
- Interactive command-line interface for encryption and decryption.
- Flexible shift values, supporting both positive and negative integers.
- Robust handling of non-alphabetic characters.

**Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher-python.git
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to encrypt and decrypt messages.
